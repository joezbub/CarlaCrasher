# Carla Crasher
Like automatic_control.py, CarlaCrasher allows you to spectate a self-driving car in the Carla simulator. However, the car is programmed to drive poorly.

# Install
Clone the repository and move it into the PythonAPI directory.

# Run
cd into CarlaCrasher and run `python crasher.py`. You should see a pygame window pop up with a self-driving car driving through the simulator.
